Contributing
============

Do you want to contribute to the bootstrap-vz project? Nice! Here is the basic workflow:

* Fork this repository.
* Make any changes you want/need.
* Commit your changes.
* Squash the commits if needed. For instance, it is fine if you have multiple commits describing atomic units
of work, but theres no reason to have many commits just because of corrected typos.
* Push to your fork, preferable on a topic branch.

By this moment, there are two paths that you have to consider:

If you patch is a new feature, e.g.: plugin, provider, etc. then:

* Send a pull request to the `development` branch. It will be merged to the `master` branch when we can make
sure that the code is stable.

If it as a bug/security fix:

* Send a pull request to the `master` branch.

Please try to be very descriptive about your changes when you write a pull request, stating what it does, why
it is needed, what use cases do you think it would be useful, etc.

Be aware that your modifications needs to be properly documented and pushed to the `gh-pages` branch.

Happy hacking! :-)
